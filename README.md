# Python


Exercise 1.1:

    Task - Goals:

    Create python file with python program to add two numbers using basic python syntax

    add.py file that adds two numbers
    requirments.txt holds dependencies for virtual enviroment
    screenshots of creating new virtual enviroment, installing ipython to enviroment, copy dependencies to a new virtual enviroment


Exercise 1.2:
    
    Task - Goals:

    Chose the data storage type explain why you chose this type.
    Create a recipe list with 5 recipes. The list is to include:

    name (str): Contains the name of the recipe
    cooking_time (int): Contains the cooking time in minutes
    ingredients (list): Contains a number of ingredients, each of the str data type
    
    recipe_1 = {'Name': 'Tea', 'Cooking_Time': '5 Minutes', 'Ingredients':['Tea Leaves', 'Sugar', 'Water']}


    I chose dictionaries for storing the data for each recipe because it allows different data types to be stored and the flexibility that dictionaries brings
    Dictionaries can store the recipe names as strings, the ingredients as lists and for the cooking time as an integer, however I chose to store it as string to include 'minutes' with the integer.
    Dictionaries are also mutable, so each recipe can be updated or added to in future.
    
    all_recipes = []
  
    I chose to use lists for the outer structure to store the recipe dictionaries because lists are sequential, are mutable, able to store multiple recipes and can be updated or added to in future.
